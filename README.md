# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

Problem sets and projects for Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course.

To complete the following psets, I studied all of the cs50 lectures, walkthroughs and shorts on edX.  
To memorize all the theoretical knowledge I made over 500 hundred [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards that I review everyday.  
All problem set submissions received scores of 100% from the [cs50x gradebook](http://imgur.com/a/Ac7l8).
