1.  stdint.h is a header file that provide a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, ie. uint8_t. 
2.  This types let you use memory in a more a specific way. With those typedef's you can use allocate less than 4 bytes for integer number.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2.
4.  0x42 0x4D (hexadecimal)
5.  biSize is size of BITMAPINFOHEADER in bytes which is the same for all .bmp files (40 bytes).
    bfSize is size in bytes of actual bitmap file.
6.  It means that bitmap is a top-down DIB and its starting point is in the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  It may happen if user won't pass file names from command-line
9.  We need to read only one BITMAPINFOHEADER and BITMAPFILEHEADER from the stream
10. 0
11. It let you set new position indicator in a stream by given offset (padding in our case).
12. SEEK_CUR is a constant that is replacement for current position of the file pointer.
